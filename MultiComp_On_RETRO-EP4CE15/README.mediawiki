=== Blink_LED - Tested/Works ===

* Blink the (4) LEDs on the FPGA card plus an external LED
* Uses a large internal counter to divide down the 50 MHz clock rate

== Ownership ==

* Some of these files such as FPGA designs and software libraries were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
