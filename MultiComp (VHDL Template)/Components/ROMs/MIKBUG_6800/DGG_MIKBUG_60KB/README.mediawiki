= MIKBUG =

* Actually is SmithBug variant of MIKBUG
* 60KB SRAM variant
** Supports much smaller SRAM sizes but requires scratchpad SRAM if ther is less than 60KB of SRAM
*** Scratchpad RAM has to be at 0xEF00-0xEFFF (minimum 256 bytes)

=	SmithBug Memory Map =

* 0x0000-0x7FFF - 32KB Internal SRAM
* 0XEC00-0xEFFF - 1KB Internal SRAM (SCRATCHPAD SRAM USED BY MIKBUG)
* 0xFC18-0xFC19 - VDU (serSelect J3 JUMPER REMOVED)
* 0xFC28-0xFC19 - ACIA
* 0xFC30-0xFC3F - Front Panel
* 0xF000-0xFFFF - MIKBUG (Actually SMITHBUG) ROM

= Hardware =

* Tested/runs on all MultiComp based designs
** SRAM accesses run at 25 MHz on Internal SRAM
** Different FPGAs can support more of less internal SRAM
*** EP2C5 FPGA supports 3KB internal SRAM
*** [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=RETRO-EP4CE15 EP4CE15 FPGA] supports 32KB internal SRAM
*** [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=RETRO-EP4CE15 Cyclone V FPGA] supports 60KB internal SRAM
** External SRAM works on all MultiComp based designs and supports 60KB SRAM
*** SRAM accesses run at 16.6 MHz on External SRAM
