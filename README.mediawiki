== FPGA Boards ==

The different folders here reflect the hardware that we have got Multicomp running on. Some of these designs are Land Boards and others are based on commercial products.

=== MultiComp On Cyclone IV VGA Card ===

* [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=Cyclone_IV_FPGA_EP4CE6E22C8N_Development_Board_USB_V2 Purchased EP4 FPGA card]
** Includes VGA, PS/2 and USB-Serial converter
** Other I/O is serious limitation but a 16K retro machine without SD Card storage can easily be built

== Ownership ==

* Some of these files such as FPGA designs and software libraries were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
