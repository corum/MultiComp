== Multicomp in a Box ==

* These are the VHDL files for our implementation of [http://searle.x10host.com/Multicomp/index.html Grant Searle's Multicomp] Retro-Computer.
** Grant's projects re-create late 1970's and early 1980's era vintage computers using inexpensive FPGA cards.
** We've extended Grant's original design to include other vintage CPU designs
* This puts the Multicomp design into an enclosure
* Our [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=RetroComputers RetroComputing Wiki page is here].

== Card Set ==

* This design uses the following cards
** [[RETRO-EP4CE15]] FPGA Baseboard
** [[QM Tech Cyclone V FPGA Board]]
** [[SD CARD X49]]
** [[SWLEDX8|Slide switches card]] - Using 4 slide switches

== Ownership ==

* Some of these files such as FPGA designs and software libraries were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
