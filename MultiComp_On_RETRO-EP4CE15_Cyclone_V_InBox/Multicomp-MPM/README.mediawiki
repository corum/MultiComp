The system's main specifications are:

* New ROM monitor with multi-boot capability, Format, Getsys and Putsys tools and debug capabilities.
** No BASIC in ROM.
* SD-HC capable card controller.
** Init at 250 kHz, running at 25 MHz. (Issue in the box).
* Improved keyboard definition featuring external keymap and added key functionality.
* Multi volume disk system, which currently supports upto 253 8MB disk volumes (which uses 2GB+ on the SD-card).
** All these volumes can be loaded with a separate OS bootimage.
* OSes configured with 3 drives: A:, B: and C:. A: for the system drive (holding the volume booted from) while B: and C: can be assigned and re-assigned one of the remaining volumes.
** Also a RAM disk is available for CP/M 2 and CP/M 3 systems.
* Y2k compatible system clock (date and time) for all OSes.
* Included are CP/M 2.2, Dos+ 2.5, CP/M 3.0, MPMII 2.1, ZSDOS 1.1/ZCPR2, ZPM3/ZCCP and NASCOM ROM Basic
* It runs on the EP5CA2 Cyclone V FPGA and the configuration assumes it to be wired up as indicated on Grant's page.
** You should have wired up 2 serial terminals, an SD-card and at least 512k Memory. 

This package contains VHDL updates for

* ROM monitor
** New concept
* SD-card controller
** With added SD-HC capability
* Serial terminals with programmable baudrates
** Simplified version introduced by Max Scane
* MMU
** Simplified version from the one introduced by James Moxham
* Microcomputer .vdh file.
** ROM-switch, timer interrupt, SD-clock)
* SCBTextDisplayRGB.vhd, to include an external keymap and key updates.
* These are available as source files, with additionally, the .pof file for the default configuration.
* The package includes all binaries, source files, manuals and instructions for building and running the various operating systems, including tools for the additional features (disk mounting system reset etc.)
** Pre-configured images are included for system disks and Cyclone programming. 
* The OS specific transient commands are included as binary only.
* An Open Document Spreadsheet is provided to build custom keymaps.
