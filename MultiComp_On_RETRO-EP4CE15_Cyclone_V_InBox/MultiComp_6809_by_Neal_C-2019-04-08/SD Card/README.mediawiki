=== CamelFORTH ===

CamelForth is a Forth implementation for embedded microprocessors. It is compatible with ANS Forth. It was originally developed as an educational project for The Computer Journal, but has since become popular for embedded systems programming.

=== FUZIX ===

FUZIX is a fusion of various elements from the assorted UZI forks and branches beaten together into some kind of semi-coherent platform and then extended from V7 to somewhere in the SYS3 to SYS5.x world with bits of POSIX thrown in for good measure.

=== NitrOS-9 ===

NitrOS-9 is a real-time, process-based, multitasking, multi-user, Unix-like operating system for Tandy CoCo, Dragon, and several other Motorola MC6809-based computers. The original OS-9 was created in 1979. NitrOS-9 is the modern equivalent of that OS, and includes advanced features like support for up to 2 MB RAM and 4 GB Hard drive partitions. It is still being developed, and support is available in many mailing lists and forums.
NitrOS-9 stands out for several reasons. Some of its strong points are: 

* File managing capabilities.
* Multi-user features. With NitrOS-9, more than one person can use the same computer at the same time.
* Multi-tasking. NitrOS-9 can handle several jobs at the same time.
* Window functions that let you divide your display screens into sections in which you can have one or more operations running, all at the same time.
* Input/Output capabilities. NitrOS-9 can communicate with TVs and monitors, disk drives, printers, and other computers.
* A sophisticated repertoire of commands.
* Sophisticated programming languages.
