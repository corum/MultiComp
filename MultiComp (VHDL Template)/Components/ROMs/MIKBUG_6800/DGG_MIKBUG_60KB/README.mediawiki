= MIKBUG =

* Actually is SmithBug variant of MIKBUG
* 60KB SRAM variant
** Supports much smaller SRAM sizes but requires scratchpad SRAM
*** Scratchpad RAM has to be at 0xEF00-0xEFFF

=	Memory Map =

* 0x0000-0x7FFF - 32KB Internal SRAM
* 0XEC00-0xEFFF - 1KB Internal SRAM (SCRATCHPAD SRAM USED BY MIKBUG)
* 0xFC18-0xFC19 - VDU (serSelect J3 JUMPER REMOVED)
* 0xFC28-0xFC19 - ACIA
* 0xFC30-0xFC3F - Front Panel
* 0xF000-0xFFFF - MIKBUG (Actually SMITHBUG) ROM

= Hardware =

* Runs on all MultiComp based designs
** Different FPGAs can support more of less internal SRAM
*** EP2C5 FPGA supports 3KB internal SRAM
*** EP4CE15 FPGA supports 32KB internal SRAM
*** Cyclone V FPGA supports 60KB internal SRAM
